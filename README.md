# 🔥 Employee Burnout Analysis & Prediction  

## What If Burnout Could Be Predicted Before It Happens?

What if employee burnout was not something organizations *reacted* to—but something they could **measure, model, and prevent**?

This project treats burnout as a **data problem**, not a mystery. Using measurable work-behavior variables—work hours, screen time, meetings, sleep, breaks, and after-hours activity—it analyzes how daily patterns **systematically increase or reduce burnout risk**.

Through **data visualization** and **machine learning**, this repository identifies the strongest drivers of burnout and builds predictive models that estimate:

- **Burnout Risk** (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`)
- **Burnout Score** (continuous intensity measure)

The goal is simple and factual: **detect burnout early using data, before performance and well-being collapse**.
